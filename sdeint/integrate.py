"""
Numerical integration algorithms for Ito and Stratonovich stochastic ordinary
differential equations.

Usage:
    itoint(f, G, y0, tspan)  for Ito equation dy = f dt + G dW
    stratint(f, G, y0, tspan)  for Stratonovich equation dy = f dt + G \circ dW

    y0 is the initial value
    tspan is an array of time values (currently these must be equally spaced)
    function f is the deterministic part of the system (scalar or  dx1  vector)
    function G is the stochastic part of the system (scalar or  d x m matrix)

sdeint will choose an algorithm for you. Or you can choose one explicitly:

    itoEuler: the Euler Maruyama algorithm for Ito equations.
    stratHeun: the Stratonovich Heun algorithm for Stratonovich equations.
    itoSRI2: the Roessler 2010 order 1.0 strong Stochastic Runge-Kutta
      algorithm SRI2 for Ito equations

    This algorithm is suitable for Ito systems with an arbitrary noise

         2m+1 times at each time step so complexity grows quadratically with m.

         Alternatively you can provide a list of m functions g(y, t) each
         defining one column of G (each returning an array of shape (d,).
         In this case each g will be evaluated 3 times at each time step so

        Ito integrals. Here you can choose either sdeint.Ikpw (the default) or
