"""
Numerical integration algorithms for Ito and Stratonovich stochastic ordinary
differential equations.

Usage:
    itoint(f, G, y0, tspan)  for Ito equation dy = f dt + G dW
    stratint(f, G, y0, tspan)  for Stratonovich equation dy = f dt + G \circ dW

    y0 is the initial value
    tspan is an array of time values (currently these must be equally spaced)
    f is the deterministic part of the system (can be a scalar or  dx1  vector)
    G is the stochastic part of the system (can be a scalar or  d x m matrix)

sdeint will choose an algorithm for you. Or you can choose one explicitly:

Algorithms implemented so far:
    itoEuler: the Euler Maruyama algorithm for Ito equations.
    stratHeun: the Stratonovich Heun algorithm for Stratonovich equations.
